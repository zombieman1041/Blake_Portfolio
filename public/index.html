            <h3>Portfolio Questions</h3>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            Westmont Downtown proposed these questions for me as a Westmont Downtown student to highlight my personal journey and the major motivations that have influenced my life. This program is a Westmont College off-campus program that equips its students with skills for the business world and life through tailored mentoring, empathetic collaboration, community engagement, and creative challenges.             
            <br><br><h5>Part One—I Contain Multitudes</h5>
            
<b>1. What is your experience with giving back to others in your community? Have you ever been involved in any campaigns to make a difference in the world?</b>
            <br><br>
            My experience to giving back to others In my community Includes being a volunteer for an outreach program to the entertainment Industry through 3rd Tuesday hosted by St. Louis Family Church. I am an active volunteer whenever I am back home during the event where I would help serve refreshments to the guests there Interested to hear God's word. Through my experience I have realized that God Is still doing his work In the world through me and the other volunteers at 3rd Tuesday and even though the world has turned away from God, He Is still at work and has not given up on them. There are guests that have become regulars to this event and there are also always newcomers that get to hear Jesus's story and receive prayer. These Influencers In the entertainment Industry can have a big Impact In entertainment and can make a major change on what consumers consume as entertainment. I am very blessed that I get to become a part of this outreach and make a difference In changing the entertainment Industry. 
            <br><br><b>
Whether you gave a public comment, attended a collaborative meeting, or researched and compiled a packet of letters to a public official, what was the experience like for you? What did you learn? What made you uncomfortable? How was it an experience of “proximate justice” for you? Were you able to experience hope? Why or why not?
            <br><br></b>
An area in my life where I experienced proximate justice Is through my pursuit of having discussions with others on political issues that I have grown passionate about even when those discussions conflicted with my own views. Some of these Issues Include economic and education Inequality, racial discrimination, and climate change to name a few. At times the discussions can become uncomfortable when I meet someone who has a conflicting point of view to an issue and are in a hard disagreement with one another. I made It a priority to have these tense and uncomfortable discussions in a healthy manner so I can retain my relationships with those that participate in these discussions.
These discussions have given me the opportunity to learn more about the Issues I care about from different perspectives, pros and cons to potential solutions and also show others my perspective and potential solutions to these major Issues. By having these discussions, it gives me more Information when It comes to taking part of my civic duty to vote in public officials that can bring about the change I want to see in the world. Additionally, I also get to have some Influence on those that I had discussions with to change their vote too. Outside of voting If an opportunity to ever arise that relates to the major Issues, I will be going in much more educated in the topic than If I had not had those past discussions. An opportunity could look like participating in a non-profit organization against climate change. Although I am not directly solving an Issue by myself I do feel hope and peace when the discussions go well and I get to make that small Impact like a breakthrough In positive change and electing leaders that can make that bigger change with the power they are given. 
            <br><br><b>
2. Reflect on your SOI test results and the team discussion. What are your greatest talents and your signature strengths? How do you stand out from other people? What unique gifts do you have to offer the world? 
            <br><br></b>
My greatest talents and strengths are being supportive of others, responsive to others, high task orientation, and like to organize. By being self sufficient and a great deal of drive, I am able to get the define the task and get the job done within a group. I can manage structures already In place and Implement Ideas and execute a plan with my team. 
For the SOI assessment to really matter, it’s key to determine specific ways to incorporate your strengths intentionally into your life. Researchers have discovered that people are much happier when they use their strengths on a daily basis in new and creative ways. People can even transform boring jobs into ones that they enjoy by using their strengths more. How can you use your strengths more often in your day-to-day life? 
I use my skills in my day to day life when approaching daily problems. I like to strategize and organize plans with approval with those closest around me for support. This can look like asking peer review for papers or assignments due and doing the same with those that need the support as well. This role also applies to my recreational time by organizing hang outs, jam sessions, and sports with my friends. When It comes to preparing to tests I also love to organize study sessions with my fellow classmates. 
            <br><br><b>
            3. What are you grateful for? Record 3 to 5 things for which you give thanks: good things that happened to you today, things that you normally take for granted. 
            <br><br></b>
By the end of this week, I see that I am grounded In who I am as a person and I use the what has happened In the past to help me learn and prepare for the future with a positive and healthy attitude. I take relationships very seriously and with those relationships as a source of support I can take on the world head first. 
            <br><br><h5>Part Two—Reading the Whole Story</h5>
            <b>
4. What matters most in your life? What are the things that you value more than anything else in the world? Narrow down this list to two primary values. Are you living consistently with these values? Are you spending most of your time on the things that really matter deeply to you?
            <br><br></b>
What matters most In my life Is my relationship with God and His plan on how he wants to use me on this Earth. The things that I value most In the world Is friendships, relationships, happiness, faith, and family. The two primary values I hold out of these would be relationships and faith. These values I consistently hold throughout my daily life. I hold relationships highly with those I meet and take very seriously and faith as my moral compass and the meaning behind why I do what I do and have planned for the future.  
            <br><br><b>
    5. Think of the best things you’ve done in your work as a student. Make a list. Organize the list either by importance or value. Ask others what they’ve seen in or through you. What creative things have you done that have inspired you or others? Why and how have these things been uplifting? Notice the trends and reflect on your particular contribution as a creative being.

I have inspired people through my relationships I have developed with those that I have met through my bright personality and my efforts to reflect who Jesus is as a follower of Christ. I cant explain why throughout my life people have just been attracted to me but I definitely feel blessed to have many friends in my life. Some things that I have done that was uplifting and inspiring are the projects I did in the APP Academy, the music I performed in the Jazz band, and my involvement in 3rd Tuesday and the SSA organization. The list I created was inspiring for me because they all contributed towards teamwork and activities that are important to society and myself. 
<br><br><b>
6. What gives you the greatest sense of fulfillment, personal satisfaction, and self-esteem? Why? When are you so engaged and absorbed in an activity that time seems to stop? What are the times in your life when everything seems to flow, and you are in “the zone”? What are the things that you do that give you the greatest returns on happiness, productivity, and contribution? 
<br><br></b>Friends, family, social gatherings like movies, games, restaurants etc. These things give me the greatest sense of fulfillment, personal satisfaction, and self-esteem because I appreciate others company and definitely feel time flies when I’m around those I feel comfortable with.

            <br><br><h5>Part Three—The Things Residual</h5> 
            <b>
    7. What is your family history? Trace the geographic journey that you and your ancestors took to get you here today. What part of your family tradition, culture, ethnicity, or heritage most resonates with you? How do elements shape who you are today? What adversities have you or members of your family overcome? Tell stories of how you/they managed to triumph over such troubles. What factors contributed to your/their resilience? How might these experiences or stories influence your world and habits of thinking?
            <br><br></b>
    I grew up here in California where I was influenced by science and technology through my family history’s strong science background. On my mom’s side, my grandpa came here with his family to America to flee from the communist revolution in China. In America he got an education and contributed towards the science advancements JPL had achieved. Today he has a family business that makes scientific instruments. On my dad’s side, my grandpa graduated from Caltech and also worked at JPL where he too contributed towards advancing science. My dad with this influence fixes computers on the side while his main occupation is project management. These parts of my family history I strongly resonate with and shaped me today as I work to complete my degree in computer science because it was what I grew up with and personally seeing all the amazing things science can and has achieved.

8. Write a letter of gratitude to one person who has had a profound influence on your life, but whom you have never fully acknowledged. They may be someone you have never even met. Thank them for the powerful, positive impact that they made in your life. If possible, send the letter to the person. Write a brief reflection about this activity. What did you learn, how do you feel? 
            <br><br></b>
Dear Jonah,
            <br><br>
Thanks so much for making such a big influence in my life. The friendship I have with you has certainly helped bring clarity in my life that gave me a realization of my values. All the experiences we had in high school both good and bad has shown me that no matter what life might throw at me there are always friends out there that have my back and knowing that has improved my mental health drastically. Hope your well and can’t wait what life has in store for us next. 
            <br><br>
Sincerely,
            <br> 
Blake

9. What have been your favorite creative inspirations throughout your life? What are the books, movies, art works, songs, or other hobbies and creative activities that you have most enjoyed? How do they shape who you are today? 
<br><br></b>
Music has been a creative inspiration throughout my life. I always loved music and during middle school I found an instrument that finally called out to me. This instrument was the electric bass. I played the electric bass in a middle school rock band and continued in high school through the school’s jazz band. It’s a dedicated hobby of mine and has additionally contributed to my love for music. I love a majority of music from jazz, to rock, to electronic music. It helps me focus and also is a major outlet to let out stress through jam sessions, concerts, raves, and just another way to hang out with friends.  
            <br><br><h5>Part Four—Living the Questions</h5> 
10. Identify both fears and idols that hold you back from understanding what God has for you. When things fall apart, what do you do to “keep things together?” Reflect on how to incorporate this information into your life to achieve your full potential. 
Some of the fears and idols that hold me back from understanding what God has for me is being overwhelmed with work, bad relationships, and worries on how those perceive me when I am actively trying to get to know someone new. When things fall apart I pick myself back up by relying on the already established friend and family circles that I know are there for me as I am for them. By knowing this information, I have made it a priority to hold relationship as a close value of mine wherever I go and use this value as a tool for what God has in store for me. 
11. Describe your experiences this semester of praying corporately with your peers every Tuesday and Thursday. What have you noticed about this practice? To what extent has it been a struggle? To what extent has it been a blessing? Why?
The experiences of corporate prayer have been a new experience for me and I find it as a blessing. It’s so nice to have an established Christian group that I can pray with and address any local and global stressors that has been affecting us as well as having a group to also praise and thank God together. It always feels like a breath of fresh air for me because it’s the time I can bring myself back to that close relationship with God and making that relationship with my Christian peers enhances that experience. 
12. For this reflection, think about N.T. Wright’s chapter, “Light of the World,” which you read in the Internship Class. There, Wright makes a specific argument about the calling of Christians today. He suggests that Jesus’s death and resurrection ushers in an era of New Creation, where followers of Jesus are called to participate in the redemption of the whole of creation by announcing “in deed and word that the exile is offer, to enact the symbols that speak of healing and forgiveness, to act boldly in God’s word in the power of the Spirit.” He then gives two examples of this by talking about the fields of information technology and art and the way in which they are twisted and broken, with some possible thoughts about how a Christian could act redemptively in these areas (pp. 185-7).

Repeat this exercise for yourself. Think about yourself—your own gifts, talents and interests. Think about the places in the Creation, both literally and metaphorically, that God has placed you. Where is the light of God's redemptive power yet to shine? Where is it darkest? In the areas of human life where you have an interest, what could be done to creatively announce in deed and word that the exile is over?
Given the gifts, talents, and interests that I have developed and the places God has placed me, I feel God is going to have me shine in the people skills that I am discovering for professional uses. I have always had a high EQ but never thought of it being used in my craft as a computer scientist. I am convinced that God has a plan to use me in the computer science field paired with my personality to change the lives of those that have yet to know who God truly is.

            <br><br><h5>Five—Tell It Slant</h5> 
14. In your internship class, you conducted a wayfinding exercise in which you traced some of the most significant “engagements” in your life over the last few years, and how they relate (or don’t relate) to each other. Remember that engagements are those projects, activities or experiences that were notable in your life. These engagements should have been comprehensive in nature, and might include aspects of your formal education, professional explorations or aspirations, interests, hobbies, milestones, achievements, significant relationships, travel—anything that was a significant in your life over the last few years. They might have been positive or negative. If these engagements were part of a thought out, intentional “track,” they were connected by straight lines. If they were more loosely connected “wanders,” they were connected by a squiggly line. They could also be stand-alone experiences. 

As part of your portfolio, reconstruct your wayfinding map. You can make alterations to the original, or keep it as is. This time though, highlight particularly notable engagements, whether they were positive or negative with a star. (You could also choose to use various colors to represent different things, paths, positive and negative experiences—go crazy.)
 
Now, write a reflection on this wayfinding map. Here are some questions to consider. What were the most significant engagements, positive or negative. What made them significant? What exactly was it about them that made those experiences stand out? What exactly was it about those engagements that made them satisfying or jarring? Were they surprising in any way? What did you learn from them? Did any wanders or paths just come to an end? Why? If you could go back in time, what you wish to continue any of them? Looking forward into the future, do the paths suggest an obvious direction forward? Should some of your wanders turn into paths? 
I really enjoyed this part of the portfolio. It’s nice to see a diagram of the highlights in my life both the highs and lows. The most significant engagements in my life was being part of the APP Academy that has opened up so many opportunities in my life. These opportunities consisted of getting accepted into my top choice for college, Westmont College, being a member of the Safe School Ambassador organization that fights against bullying in schools, finding a career in computer science and web design I want to pursue, and landing an internship at Landmark Global. Another significant engagement was my high school relationship where although it was a negative experience it was significant because it helped me realize how important friendships were to me through the friends that helped me through that negative experience. This helped me grow as a person by bringing friendship as one of my top values in life. If I could go back in time I would have done that high school relationship in a much more healthy manner that would have saved the heart ache and time wasted during my High School experience. None of the engagements really came to an end because all of the engagements have room for the next opportunity that could open up my life which is very exciting. The paths that I have made so far lead to a tech-oriented career that focuses on the relationships made along the way all while living out on a Christian mission. 
15. Autobiography from 30 years in the future - Write your autobiography from the perspective of 30 years in the future. Imagine that this is the best of all possible worlds, where you have been able to live your ideal life. What have you accomplished? What transpired over your lifetime? This should be a fun, playful exercise where you talk about how you will combine your passions and dreams with your strengths and talents. Be as detailed as possible. Include a brief reflection about this activity. What did you learn, how do you feel? 
As a professional Team Lead Web Designer, I am very happy with my life. I have a family with a beautiful wife and kid that I care about very much. We live in a nice modern house in southern California where we frequently have friends over. We love to serve and have excellent hospitality to our friends and family creating a healthy entertainment space to wind down after a long week of work. On Sundays, we go to church at a non-denominational, intergenerational, multi ethnic church where we exist to make disciples. Some of my favorite hobbies include playing videogames, tennis, airsoft, and sailing. When we are able to go on vocation our favorite place to go to is Hawaii.
This was an interesting activity for the portfolio. It was reassuring to know I am already down a path in my life that I can look forward to without too much uncertainty. It’s also very exciting to know what God has in store for me and how my perception of what my future might look like in comparison to God’s plan for me. I feel very excited for what my future is going to look like in the next 30 years. On the other hand its also a little concerning thinking what the world might look like in the next 30 years physically, politically, and economically with how the current circumstances that could affect the society we are all currently living in.
16. A summary of what you have learned: Now that you have completed this portfolio and have hopefully come to some greater clarity on who you are and where your most significant points of contribution can be, what is your vision of how you would like to make a difference in the world? What knowledge, concepts and tools have you developed (through writing, reflecting, and discussion with your cohort), and how might you begin to apply them? 
My vision on how I would like to make a difference in the world would be in the areas of my work and my relationships. As a computer scientist, I see myself reflecting Jesus in team lead roles and just spreading his good nature and open up opportunities of conversation to spread the good news of Jesus Christ. Additionally, I see myself doing the same in the relationships I have established already and the new ones I am going to make. I’ve learned a lot in leadership through the activities that Westmont Downtown has set up for our cohorts and I plan to continue working on those leadership traits as I continue on after college. I believe I have the spiritual gift of hospitality and envision myself to continue to refine that gift and use it in such a way to change people’s lives to bring glory in God’s name.
